 *  Description:
 *     Hazelcast Java demo: Near cache writer Java application.
 *
 *     The Near Cache ID refers to the identifier of a Near Cache configuration. When
 *     you create a NearCacheConfig using new NearCacheConfig(id), you are defining a
 *     caching layer that sits on the client side, allowing for faster access to frequently
 *     used data.
 *     The Near Cache ID is used to configure and manage the Near Cache associated with a
 *     specific distributed map. The Near Cache stores a local copy of the data for quick
 *     access, reducing the need to fetch data from the distributed map for frequently
 *     accessed entries.
